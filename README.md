## Beginner's Quick Start Tutorial üìñ Tutorial

### Simple Quick Start Tutorial (Completion of this section is considered the beginning of mastering CapsLockX)

CapsLockX has four core functions: **window management**, **mouse emulation**, **arrow key emulation**, and application-specific hotkeys. This beginner tutorial will teach you the first three core functions.

First, get CapsLockX: download this zip file: [Download JSDelivrCDN - Release Package.zip](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/snolab/CapsLockX@gh-pages/CapsLockX-latest.zip)

After unzipping, open `CapsLockX.exe` within the CapsLockX folder, get past the simple beginner tutorial, and then try out the following functions in the left and right-hand feature areas to understand the capabilities of CapsLockX.

Once CapsLockX is started, it will **not affect** the functionality of other keys on your keyboard. The following features are triggered only when you press `CapsLockX + combination keys`.

Left-hand feature area:

- Window management: `CapsLockX + 1234567890` switches to the `n`th virtual desktop, `CapsLockX + ZXCV` for window operations (window switching, window closing, window arranging, transparency top-most).
- Mouse emulation function: Press `CapsLockX + WASD` to move the mouse (as simple as moving a character while playing a game), press `CapsLockX + QE` for left and right mouse clicks, `CapsLockX + RF` for scrolling up and down.

Right-hand feature area:

- Arrow key emulation: Open any text editor (such as Notepad), press `HJKL` to move the cursor, `YOUI` to move the page

After familiarizing yourself with the basic features, consult the quick reference guide below for more advanced functionalities.

- Press `CapsLockX+Space` at the same time to lock `CLX` mode, where `CLX` will be maintained until `CapsLockX` is pressed again next time. [Origin of Function](https://github.com/snolab/CapsLockX/issues/21)

### Module Description

CapsLockX by default loads some commonly used modules. The features and how to use them are listed below.
If you don't need certain modules, you can also directly delete the `.ahk` files in the `./Modules` directory, and then press `Ctrl + Alt + \` to reload.

You can also write your own `my-ahk.user.ahk` and put it in the `./User/` directory, and CapsLockX will automatically recognize and load them.

### Nightmares of Multitasking

#### Virtual Desktop Overview: Scenario Modes, Work Desks, Entertainment Desks, Project Categories...

Typically, a set of tasks a user is currently performing will include multiple windows. These windows combined can constitute a usage scenario, while multiple scenarios are likely to run at the same time, and some of them will run for a long time, without interference. This will involve a lot of window arrangement and virtual desktop switching operations, in these aspects, using CLX to manage your windows will bring a terrifying efficiency improvement.

Below are some examples of scenario combinations: Suppose you can study, work on several different jobs, chat with friends, play games, listen to BGM in the background, and have a paused movie ready to watch with family in the evening.

- Virtual desktop 1: Planning scenario: Schedule window + Multi-platform sync notes, e.g.: Google Calendar + Notion + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 2: Learning scenario: Book reading window, note-taking window, e.g.: OneNote + Calibre, etc.
- Virtual desktop 3: Work scenario 1 (Front-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Browser, e.g.: Chrome(dev) + VSCode + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 4: Work scenario 2 (Back-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Backend terminal + Database browser, e.g.: DBeaver + VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 5: Work scenario 3 (Script Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Script target, e.g.: VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) etc.
- Virtual desktop 6: Work scenario 4 (3D Modeling and Rendering): 3D modeling software + Material searching, e.g.: Blender + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 5 (3D Printing Slicing): Slicing software + Model searching window, e.g.: Cura + [thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 6 (Video Processing): Editing + Material management, e.g.: PR + Everything.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 7 (Video Processing): Post-production + Documentation tutorial, e.g.: AE + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 8: Writing scenario: Writing window, material referencing window, e.g.: Obsidian + Chrome (Google Scholar Index), etc.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 1: Casual chats, e.g.: Telegram + Reddit + .
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 2: Work communication, e.g.: Slack + Skype + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 3: Presentation, e.g.: Google Meeting + (Vscode | Page application | Requirements document | Feedback document).
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 1: Playing games, e.g.: Age of Empires, Minecraft, Skyrim, Overcooked 2, etc.
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 3: Watching movies, listening to songs, e.g.: PotPlayer, Youtube Music, etc...
- ... More examples are welcome. Provide Issues or PRs for supplementation.

Snowstar does not recommend you handle too many tasks at the same time, but CapsLockX can save your thinking environment, greatly reducing the mental cost you incur during task switching, that is, saving you a lot of time rearranging windows and the resulting loss of attention.

(Note: If you like to handle many tasks at the same time, you might need not only a computer with not a small amount of memory but also a brain of significant capacity :D )

#### Enhancing the User Experience of Windows Window Switching - Win+Tab

When switching windows with Alt+Tab, if there are too many windows, a two-dimensional window pre-arrangement display will show up.
Generally speaking, Alt+Tab and Alt+Shift+Tab are purely left-handed keystrokes. If the user wants to select the window in the next line, they will instinctively press Alt+Tab many times.
However, the directional keys used for two-dimensional operations are often ignored because the right hand is usually on the mouse or on the J key.

Also, users will continue to hold down the Alt key after releasing the Tab key to browse the windows and select the target window to switch to.
In CLX, Alt+WASD will be used instead of the arrow keys to perform multiline window switching directly with the left hand, so there is no need to press Shift to go back to the left.
Moreover, if a user needs to clean up or close multiple windows, they simply press Alt+X to batch clean multiple target windows while remaining within the window browsing interface.

In CLX, these features greatly improve the usability of Alt+Tab.

### Mouse Simulation Plugin (WASD QERF)

> I've always prided myself on being a keyboard warrior, likely starting after injuring my finger joints while modeling in the past, thus becoming a heavy keyboard user. I use various keyboard acceleration tools and actively memorize a multitude of shortcuts to minimize mouse usage, even learning vim and emacs. However, many times the mouse is irreplaceable, especially when graphical interfaces are prevalent.

‚Äî‚Äî The above is a passage from the author of [SimClick Mouse Simulation](https://github.com/rywiki/simclick), a work that simulates mouse behavior through a grid subdivision approach and can complement this project.

‚Äî‚Äî Recommended by [Qin Jinwei](http://rsytes.coding-pages.com/)

## Features

- This module uses the key area: CapsLockX + QWER ASDF
- Comfortably use WASD QE RF to simulate [complete] mouse functionality. Trust me, after trying this feel, you'll like it.
- The pointer automatically sticks to various buttons and hyperlinks when moving. The exponential growth of the wheel's acceleration scroll mechanism means you'll no longer fear super long articles and web pages.

- Use Pomodoro time announcements (Work bell sounds at o'clock and half-past, rest bell sounds at 25 and 55 minutes past every hour) ‚Äî requires scheduled tasks to be enabled

  ```ini
  UseTomatoLife=1
  ```

- When using Pomodoro announcements, automatically switch desktops (Automatically switch to desktop 1 for rest, and to desktop 2 for work during Pomodoro announcements)

  ```ini
  UseTomatoLifeSwitchVirtualDesktop=1
  ```

Note: If you only need the sound without the automatic desktop switching, you might want to try this Chrome extension [Tomato Life - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/25min-tomato-life/kkacpbmkhbljebmpcopjlgfgbgeokbhn)

Further Note: This plugin has been spun off into a standalone project. If you like the Pomodoro Technique, you can refer to the snowstar's tomato-life project here: [snom

### Auto Screen Off on Lock

When locking the screen with Win + L, the screen turns off immediately. This is suitable for automatically turning off the computer screen when getting ready for sleep, to prevent it from being glaring during the night.

## Past and Future üõ∞

### Production Background (Autumn of 2017) üçÅ Background

> I often write code‚Ä¶
> At first, I was used to using the mouse with my right hand... later I found it a bit far to put the mouse on the right... so I switched to using the mouse with my left hand.
> After switching to the left hand, I realized I still had to take it off the keyboard... so I made a script that simulates the mouse with the WASD keys. (Then I could keep playing with the computer with my right hand under my chin)
> Later I wrote more and more scripts and put some of the common ones together to load...

### Development RoadMap üõ∞Ô∏è RoadMap

The core philosophy of CapsLockX is to simplify system operation logic, improve operation efficiency, and not conflict with existing habitual key positions.

1. [x] Press CapsLockX + - key to display corresponding help (the current display style is quite rough)
2. [ ] i18n (eh this really should exist)
3. [ ] Auto-update (although git pull is also fine)
4. [ ] Tutorial for first-time users (this is a bit simple now...)
5. [ ] Plugin manager (although the file system could handle it too)
6. [ ] Auto-sync of configuration (though throwing it in OneDrive is usually enough)
7. [ ] A user-friendly options configuration UI (though changing ini isn't that hard)
8. [ ] Execute external code (Python, Nodejs, external AHK, Bash, ‚Ä¶) (although running a script isn't much trouble)

### Key Combination Meaning Design ‚å® Chore Design

Win + series are generally used for operating system functions, desktop window application process management, input method, output device (display, multiple screens) management.

Alt + series typically denote invocation of application internal functions, their meanings should be equivalent to pressing the same function button, or jumping to a specific function interface.

Ctrl + series as above, but used more frequently and it's very likely that there is no button with the same function.

Ctrl + Alt + same as above, but generally for global hotkeys.

The Shift key is used to slightly change the meaning of the above functions (such as reverse operations like Shift+Alt+Tab, or extended function range like Shift+Arrow keys to adjust the selection, etc.)
